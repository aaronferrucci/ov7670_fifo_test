3V3-----Input power supply voltage (3.3,5V is recommended, but not recommended)
GDN-----grounding point
SIO_C---SCCB interface control clock (Note: some low-level microcontrollers need pull-up control, similar to I2C interface)
SIO_D---SCCB interface serial data input (output) end (Note: some low-level microcontrollers need pull-up control, similar to I2C interface)
VSYNC---frame sync signal (output signal)
HREF----line sync signal (output signal, generally not applicable, special case)
D0-D7---data port (output signal)
RESTE---Reset port (normal use pull high)
PWDN----Power consumption selection mode (normal use pull low)
STROBE—Photo flash control port (not required for normal use)
FIFO_RCK---FIFO memory read clock control terminal
FIFO_WR_CTR----FIFO write control terminal (1 is to allow CMOS to write to FIFO, 0 is forbidden)
FIFO_OE----FIFO shutdown control
FIFO_WRST—FIFO write pointer reset terminal
FIFO_RRST—FIFO read pointer reset terminal
